--> first problem statement "what is a custom , and how does it works"

properties: {
  from9to12m: {
    components: {
      edit: AdminCustomComponents.RateModelEditComponent
    },
    custom: { path: "from9to12m" }
  }
}


What custom does

The custom object is optional metadata that you can pass into your component.

Whatever you put inside custom will be available in your component props as props.property.custom.

This is not stored in MongoDB. Itâ€™s purely for passing extra information to your AdminJS component.

So in your component:

const RateModelEditComponent = (props) => {
  const { property } = props
  console.log(property.custom.path) // "from9to12m"
}


Now you can access "from9to12m" inside your component even if, for some reason, property.path is ambiguous.
